## 🎯 Overview

EBAIF is a groundbreaking framework that enables AI agents to develop novel behaviors through interaction, learning, and evolution. Unlike traditional game AI that follows scripted patterns, EBAIF agents use a combination of neural architecture search, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and distributed edge computing to evolve behaviors that emerge from complex interactions.

### 🔬 Research Innovation

- **Behavior Genome System**: Dynamic neural architectures that evolve based on performance
- **Distributed Consensus**: Validation and propagation of effective behaviors across agent networks
- **Cultural Evolution**: AI agents that learn from each other and develop collective intelligence
- **Edge Computing Integration**: Real-time behavior evolution on resource-constrained devices

```python
from ebaif import BehaviorGenome, ConsensusEngine, EmergentAgent

# Create a behavior genome
genome = BehaviorGenome(
    base_architecture="transformer",
    evolution_rate=0.1,
    mutation_probability=0.05
)

# Initialize consensus engine
consensus = ConsensusEngine(
    validation_threshold=0.8,
    propagation_delay=1.0
)

# Create an emergent agent
agent = EmergentAgent(
    genome=genome,
    consensus=consensus,
    environment="ironhaven_mmo"
)

# Start behavior evolution
agent.start_evolution()
```
